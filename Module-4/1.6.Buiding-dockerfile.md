## Building a Dockerfile

Now that we know what images are made of, let's make one ourselves via Dockerfile. For this, we're going to dockerize a Node.js application.

Let's grab our app:
You can find our app in `Files directory of this repository`
```
cd Files
tar -xf demo-app.tar
cd app/
```
We need our Dockerfile to have the following layers:

- Based on the Node.JS 10 Alpine image (node:10-alpine)
- Creates the /home/node/app/node_modules directory and sets node as the owner and group
- Copies app package* files to the working directory
- Sets the NPM registry
- The installs are prerequisite NPM packages
- Copies the rest of the app/ data to the working directory and sets the - owner and group of the working directory to node
- Switches to the node user
- Opens port 8080 to be used
- Runs the application

So let's create our Dockerfile and start.

```
vim Dockerfile
```
```
FROM node:10-alpine
RUN mkdir -p /home/node/app/node_modules && chown -R node:node /home/node/app
WORKDIR /home/node/app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm config set registry http://registry.npmjs.org/
RUN npm install
COPY --chown=node:node . .
USER node
EXPOSE 8080
CMD [ "node", "index.js" ]
```

We can now build our container using the docker build command and specifying the location of our Dockerfile. Since we're in the same directory, we can just denote this with a .. That said, we'll want to provide a name for our output image, so we'll want to use the -t flag to set a flag. If we're planning on adding this to the Docker Hub, we'll want to follow a `<username>:<imagename>` format for the tag. Since we aren't, we'll just give it the simple name of appimage.

```
docker build . -t appimage
```
We can now run our container.
```
docker run -dt --name app01 appimage
```
And see that our app is working.

```
docker inspect app01 | grep IPAddress
```
```
curl IPAddress:8080
```

`Wrap-Up`
```
Dockerfiles are built using a series of instructions, dictated by set keywords:
All Dockerfiles start with FROM.
RUN runs commands on the shell.
WORKDIR sets the working directory.
COPY copies files.
ADD also copies files, but can copy files from outside URLs.
ADD uses more resources.
We should use COPY when possible.
USER sets the working user.
EXPOSE exposes the container port.
CMD is the final command in the Dockerfile and is the command run after the container is launched.
See a full list of instructions. (https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/)
docker build <dockerfile> builds the image.
-t: Set a name; we should use <username>:<imagename> if using the Docker Hub.
```
