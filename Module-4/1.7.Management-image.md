## Management Image

Now that we've pulled down, run, and otherwise created a couple of images, we should take the time to learn how to manage them. Luckily for us, many of the commands for image management are similar to the commands we used to manage our containers themselves.

```
docker pull alpine
```

To see list of image that we current have
```
docker image ls
```
Should we desire to remove any of these images, we can use `docker image rm <container>`, or, alternatively, pair docker image prune with the -a flag to remove all images not associated with a container. Lets do this:

```
docker image prune -a
```

Finally, we can review information about any of our images using docker image inspect.

```
docker image inspect appimage
```

`Wrap-Up`
```
Images are managed similarly to containers (add image).
docker pull <image>: Pulls down an image; this happens automatically when no image is available during docker run.
docker image ls: Lists all Docker images.
--no-trunc shows the full ID.
docker image rm <image>: Removes an image.
docker image prune: Removes all dangling images.
-a: Removes all images not being used by a container.
docker image inspect <image>: Displays image data.
```
