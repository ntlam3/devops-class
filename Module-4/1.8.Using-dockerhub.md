## Using Docker Hub

If we want to share our Docker images with the world (or just our coworkers), we can create a Docker repository on the Docker Hub found at [hub.docker.com](https://hub.docker.com/). Log in or create an account with a username, password, and associated email.


From here, we'll want to switch to the command line. To upload our image to the Docker Hub, we'll need to log in from the command line.

```
docker login --username=<username>
```

Before we can push directly to our repo, however, we need to tag our image with the name of our repository in a `<username>/<reponame>` format. This is done via docker tag.

```
docker tag appimage <username>/demo-app:latest
```

We can now use the docker push command to share it.
```
docker push <username>/demo-app
```
`Wrap-Up`
```
Use the Docker Hub to host images.
docker login --username=<username>: Log in to your Docker account on the CLI.
docker tag <image> <username>/<reponame>: Tag the image with the repo name.
docker push <username>/<reponame>: Push the image to Docker Hub.
```
