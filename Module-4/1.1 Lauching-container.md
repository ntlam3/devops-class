## Launching a Container

Run a Container
```
docker run alpine
```
The container does not remain running. We can see this if we list our running containers.

```
docker container ls
```
Or
```
docker container list
```
To see a list of all containers, we can use the -a flag.
```
docker container ls -a
```

`Notice`

That each has a STATUS noting when the container was exited. To launch a container and actually be able to work with it, we can use the -i or --interactive and the -t or --tty flags.

```
docker run -it --name a-container alpine
```
`Note` that we also assigned the container a name with --name.

But when we exit, the container shuts off again:

```
docker container ls
```

To run a persistent container, we can use the -t flag alongside -d to assign a TTY. We can also ensure our containers restart should the host server shut down with the --restart flag. When this flag is set to always, this starts the container after it initially exits and any time afterward. We can also use the unless-stopped setting so it will restart unless we manually stop it, the on-failure setting should we want it to restart upon failure, or the default no which never restarts. We'll be using the command with -d or --detach, which runs the container in the background instead of dropping it into a prompt.

```
docker run -dt --name bg-container --restart always alpine
```
`Notice` how it outputs its container ID. We can also confirm it's running with our docker container ls command.

Alternatively, if we want a truly throwaway test container, we can use the --rm flag so it's removed immediately after exiting.
```
docker run -it --name rm-test --rm alpine
```
`Wrap-Up`
```
docker container ls - List running containers
-a - List all containers
docker run <image> - Create and run a container based on the provided image
-i, --interactive - Keep STDIN open
-t, --tty - Locate a psuedo-tty; without this, there's no command prompt
-d, --detach - Run the container in the background
restart <value> - Set restarting parameters
no - Never restart
always - Always restart when stopped
unless-stopped - Restart unless manually stopped
on-failure<:retries> - Restart when the container fails; we can supply the maximum amount of retries
--rm - Remove the container upon exit
--name <name> - Provide a nickname for the container
```
