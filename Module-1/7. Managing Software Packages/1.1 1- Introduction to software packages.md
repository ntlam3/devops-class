# Introduction: 

Linux applications are called Packages. A software
package is a group of files organized in a directory
structure and metadata that makes up a software 
application. 


Files contained in a package include installable scripts
configuration files, library files, commands and the
related documentation. 


The Redhat software management system was originally
called Redhat Package Manager but is now known as RPM
Package Manager (RPM). 


We can use RPM to install, remove and manage packages.


Example:

# rpm -qa

# rpm -qa | grep ssh
