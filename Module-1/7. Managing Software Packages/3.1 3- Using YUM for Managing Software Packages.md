# Managing Packages with yum: 

The yum (Yellowdog Updater Modified) is included with
RHEL/Fedora/CentOS for the management of software.

This utility requires that your system has access to a
software repository.



For Redhat: 
The Redhat Subscription Management Service grants your 
system access to software repositories but it is
restricted to subscribers only.

For CentOS:
Do not require a subscription and software repositories
are accessible to everyone. 


It allows you to install, update and remove software on
your system running RHEL, Fedora or and CentOS.

Main benefit of using the yum command is that it will
automatically resolve dependencies when you install
any software package.
