# Managing Storage with gdisk:

The gdisk utility is used to carve up disks using GPT
format.

This text based (menu driven) program allows us to
view, add, verify, modify and delete partitions among
other tasks.

It can be used to create upto 128 partitions on a single
GPT disk on systems with UEFI firmware.

Note: Skip if you don't have UEFI system.
Error: Found invalid GPT and valid MBR; converting MBR
to GPT format.




- Practical Use: 

# gdisk /dev/sdb
# ? (To list sub-commands)
# q (To quit)


- Create a GPT Partition Table and a Partition:

# gdisk /dev/sdb
# o (Labels the disk to use GPT scheme)
# y (yes)
# p (To view disk label)

- Create a 100 MB partition:
# n (Create a partition)
Use all defaults except for size)
# +200M

- Verify 
# p
- Write and save changes
# w 
# y (yes)


Note: Use partprobe if the disk had some partitions 
previously.

- Confirm the partition information:

# gdisk -l /dev/sdb
or
# grep sdb /proc/partitions


- To delete a GPT Partitions: 

# gdisk /dev/sdb
# p (view current partition table)
# d1 (delete partition number 1)
# p (verify)
# q (quit)


- Confirm the partition information:

# gdisk -l /dev/sdb
or
# grep sdb /proc/partitions
