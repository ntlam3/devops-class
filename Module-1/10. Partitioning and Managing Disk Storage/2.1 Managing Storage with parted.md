# GP- Managing Storage with parted

The parted tool is used to carve up disks on RHEL/CentOS 
systems.

This text based program allows us to view, add, check,
modify, copy, resize and delete partitions.

Parted understands and supports both MBR and GPT
schemes.

- MBR (Master boot record): Used by BIOS-based systems
- GPT (GUID partition table): Used by UEFI-based systems



Practical Use: 

- Use the parted command to see all options
# parted

- Type help to see list of subcommands
# help

- q or quit to quit.
# q 


- Create an MBR partition Table and a Partition:

# lsblk (To see the disk)

# parted /dev/sdb

# print (view current partition info)

# mklabel msdos

# mkpart primary 1 100M

# print

# quit or q

Note: Run partprobe command if the disk had any 
partitions previously. Not needed for new and
unpartitioned disks

- To confirm:
# parted /dev/sdb print
or
# grep sdb /proc/partitions



- Delete an MBR partition

# parted /dev/sdb
# print
# rm 1
# print
# q

- To confirm:
# parted /dev/sdb print
or
# grep sdb /proc/partitions
