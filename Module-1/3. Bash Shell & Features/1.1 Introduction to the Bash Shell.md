# Bash (bourne again shell) Shell: 

The shell is referred to as the command interpreter
and it is an interface between a user and the kernel.

Shell accepts instructions from users (or srcipts), 
interprets them and passes them on to kernel for 
processing. 
Kernel then utilizes all hardware and software 
components required for successfully processing the
instructions. 

RHEL/Centos supports several shells of which bash shell
is the most popular.

It is also the default shell in RHEL7. Bash shell 
provides variety of features such as variable 
manipulation, command substitution, input and output
redirection, command history, tab completion, tilde
substitution, pattern matching, metacharacters, command
aliasing, quoting, conditional execution, flow control
and shell scripting. 

The bash shell is identified by $ sign for regular 
users and the # for root user. This Shell is resident 
in /bin/bash file.
