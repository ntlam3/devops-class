Shell Script:

Shell script is just a simple text file with ".sh" 
extension, having executable permission.

For example: firstscript.sh



Writing and executing a script:

- Create a file in your current directory hello.sh.

# touch hello.sh

- Edit file:

# vi hello.sh

- Write script and save file.

#!/bin/bash
# My first script

echo "Hello World!"

wq!

- To clarify: 

#!/bin/bash = shebang (thats how the script starts)
# = Comment ( Does not execute anything)
echo "Hello World!" =  actual script



- Make the script executable:
# chmod 744 hello.sh


- Run the script:
# ./hello.sh


Output:
Hello World!
