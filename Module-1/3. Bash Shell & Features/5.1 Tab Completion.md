# Tab Completion: 

Also know as command line completion is a bash shell 
feature. You can type one or more initial characters
of a file, directory, or command name. 
Pressing the tab key once and twice helps to complete 
the entire name or display all available options.



Examples: 

#- ls /et tab

#- ls /etc/ tab

#- pass tab

#- pas tab tab
