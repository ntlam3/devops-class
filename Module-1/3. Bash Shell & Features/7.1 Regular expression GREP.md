# Regular Expression:

Also refered to as pattern matching, regex or regexp.
To keep it simple you can just refer to it as pattern
matching for now.

Pattern can be a character, series of characters, word
or sentences.

- grep (global regular expansion print): 
Linux provides a powerful tool called grep for pattern 
matching. 
The grep tool searches contents of one or more text 
files or supplied input for a regular expression. If the 
expression is matched it prints every line containing
that expression on the screen.

Example: 

#- grep test /etc/passwd

#- grep 1000 /etc/passwd

Test is the expression that you are searching for in

/etc/passwd file.

#- grep nologin /etc/passwd

Search for nologin

#- grep -v nologin /etc/passwd

To exclude nologin

#- grep -nv nologin /etc/passwd

To exclude nologin and number the lines found


#- grep ^root /etc/passwd

To search for any lines that begin with root.
Caret sign ^ marks the beginning of a line or word.

#- grep ^$ /etc/passwd

To search for all empty lines in /etc/passwd


#- grep -i root /etc/passwd

To perform case-insensitive search for root in a file.

i = case insensitive 

#- cat  /etc/passwd  | egrep 'test|root'

Searches for patterns test and root in /etc/passwd.
