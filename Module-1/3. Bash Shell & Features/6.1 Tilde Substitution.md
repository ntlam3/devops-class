# Tilde Substitution:

Also knows as tilde expansion is performed on words
that begin with the tilde ~ character.

- If ~ is used as a standalone character, it refers to
the home directory of the user running the command.

Let's look at some examples: 

Examples: 

#- echo ~
Refers to home directory of current user.


#- ls ~
 List contents of home directory

#- echo ~+

Echo current directory - similar to PWD

#- echo ~-

Refers to previous working directory

#- echo ~username

Refers to home directory of the specified user.


Note: It can be used with any commands such as cd, ls
and echo.
