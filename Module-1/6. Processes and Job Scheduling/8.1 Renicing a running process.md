# Renicing a running process: 

The niceness of a running process can be changed using
the renice command. 

Renicing will change the priority at which the process
is currently running.


Example: 

- To change the nice of a running top session from 
old priority to +5: 

1- find the PID of top 

#- pidof crond
642 (PID)

2- Change it to +5

#- renice 5 642

3- ps -el | grep top

Note: Options -u and -g can be used with renice to 
change nice values of processes owned by a user or
group members.
