# Process States:

A process changes its operating state many times during
its life cycle.

Factors such as processor load, memory availability,
process priority and response from other apps affect
how often a process changes from one state to another.

Process could be in a non-running state for a while
or waiting on another process to provide information
so that it can continue to run.

- There are five basic process states: 

  - Running
  - Sleeping	
  - Waiting
  - Stopped
  - Zombie


- Running: 

The process is being executed by the system CPU.


- Sleeping: 

The process is waiting input from a user or another
process.


- Waiting: 

The process has received the input it was waiting for
and is now ready to run as soon as its turn arrives.


- Stopped: 

The process is currently halted and will not run even
when the turn arrives, unless a signal is sent to it
to change its behavior.


- Zombie: 

The process is dead. A zombie process exists in the
process table alongside other processes but it takes
up no resources. 

Its entry exists until the parent process permits it
to die. 

A zombie process is also called a defunct process.
