- View Processes by User and group ownership:

A process can be listed by its ownership or owning
group. 

We can use the ps command for this purpose.


For example: 

- To list all processes owned by root, specify the -U
option with the command and username: 

#- ps -U root


[root@centos ~]# ps -U root
  PID TTY          TIME CMD
    1 ?        00:00:04 systemd
    2 ?        00:00:00 kthreadd
    3 ?        00:00:01 ksoftirqd/0


This command lists PID, TTY, TIME and process name for
all processes owned by the root user.



-  We can also specify -G option and the name of an 
owning group to print processes associated only with 
that group.

Example: 

#- ps -G root
