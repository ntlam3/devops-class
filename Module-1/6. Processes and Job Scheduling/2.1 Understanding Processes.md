# Understanding Processes: 

A process is a unit for provisioning system resources.
It is any program, application or command that runs on
the system.

A process is created in memory in its own address space
when a command, program or application is initiated.

Processes are organized in a hierarchial fashion.

Each process has a parent process a.k.a. a calling
process that spawns it.

A single parent process may have one or more child
processes and processes many of its attributes to
them when they are created.

Each process is assigned a unique identification number
knows as PID (Process identifier), which is used by the
kernel to manage and control the process through its
lifecycle.

Once the process is completed or terminated, this event
is reported back to its parent process and all the
resources assigned to it are then freed and the PID
is removed.

Several processes are started at system boot, many of
which sit in the memory and wait for an event to trigger
a request to use their services.

These background system processes are called daemons
and are critical for the system to operate.
