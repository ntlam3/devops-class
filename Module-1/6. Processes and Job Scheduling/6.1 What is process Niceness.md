# Understanding process Niceness: 


Each process has an assigned priority, which is
established at initiation. It is based on a numeric
value called niceness (or a nice value).


There are 40 niceness values, with -20 being the 
highest and +19 being the lowest value.


Most processes started by the system use the default
niceness of 0. 


A process running at higher priority gets more CPU
attention.


A child process inherits the niceness of its parent or
calling process.

Normally, we run programs at the default niceness but
we can change it based on system load and urgency.
