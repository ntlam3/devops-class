# Listing a specific process:

Linux (RHEL,Centos) offers the pidof and pgrep command
that only lists the PID of a specific process.

These commands have a few switches available to them.

However, their simplest use is to pass a process name
as an argument to view its PID.

For example:

- To list the PID of the crond daemon use:

#- pidof crond

or

#- pgrep crond

Also check with:

#- ps -eaf | grep crond
