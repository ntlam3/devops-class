# Understanding Job scheduling: 

Job scheduling allows a user to submit a command or a
program for execution at a specified time in the
future.

The execution of the command or program could be one
time or recurring based on pre-determined time
schedule.

One time execution is normally scheduled for an 
activity that needs to performed at low system usage
times. For example, an execution of a lengthy shell
program.

In contrast, recurring activities may include backups,
deleting old log files, system monitoring tasks, 
running custom scripts and removing unwanted files.



- Job scheduling and execution is taken care of by two
daemons: 

- atd
- crond

atd: 

atd manages the jobs scheduled to run one time in the
future.
The atd daemon retires a missed job at the same time
next day.

- crond
crond manages recurring jobs at pre-specified times.
At startup, this daemon reads schedules in files 
located in the /var/spool/cron and /etc/cron.d
directories and loads them in the memory for later
execution.

This daemon run a job at its scheduled time only and
unlike atd daemon does not entertain missed jobs.

Note: 
Neither daemon needs to restart after any additions
or changes.
