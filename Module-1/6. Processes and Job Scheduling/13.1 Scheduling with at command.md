# Scheduling with at command: 

The at command is used to schedule a one-time job in
the future.

All submitted jobs are spooled in the /var/spool/at
directory and executed by atd daemon at specified time.

This file also includes the name of the command or
script to be run.

Ways of expressing a time with the at command: 
```
at 1:20am    =  Runs at next 1:20am

at noon	     =	Runs at 12pm

at 12:42     = 	Runs at 11:42pm

at midnight  = 	Runs at 12am

at 17:01 tomorrow  =  Runs at 5:01pm, next day.

at now + 7 hours  = Runs 7 hours from now

at 3:00 1/15/2019 = Runs at 3am on Jan 15, 2019
```


You can also supply a filename with at command using 
the -f option. This command will execute that file at
specified time.

Example: 

-To run a script script.sh from a user's home directory
3 hours from now: 

#- at -f /home/user/script.sh now + 3 hours

If at is not installed, you may have to install it.

Check if installed:
#- yum list installed at

To install: 
#- yum install at
