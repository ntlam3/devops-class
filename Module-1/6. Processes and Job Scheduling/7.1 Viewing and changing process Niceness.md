# Viewing and changing process Niceness:

We can view current process priorities and niceness
values with the ps command, the top command and the 
system monitor GUI. 

- You can use -l option to look for priority:

#- ps -l

F S   UID   PID  PPID  C PRI  NI ADDR SZ WCHAN  TTY


See column seven - PRI.

Priority is calculated based on the Niceness value,
column 8 - NI.




- Run the following command:

#- ps -efl

F S UID        PID  PPID  C PRI  NI ADDR SZ WCHAN  
4 S root         1     0  0  80   0 - 32042 ep_pol 
1 S root         2     0  0  80   0 -     0 kthrea 
1 S root         3     2  0  80   0 -     0 smpboo 
1 S root         5     2  0  60 -20 -     0 worker 

Above output indicates use of default niceness for
the first 3 processes and the highest niceness of
-20 for the fourth one. 

The values are used by the process scheduler to adjust
their execution time on the CPU.




- To check the default niceness:

#- nice

0 is default.



- Changing process niceness:

You can assign a different niceness to a program or a
command at its startup.

Example 1: 

- To run the top command at a lower priority with
nice value of +2:

#- nice -2 top

From another terminal you can check with:

#- ps -el | grep top




Example 2:

- To run the top command at a higher priority with
nice value of -10. 

Note:  Two dashes

#- nice --10 top


From another terminal you can check with:

#- ps -el | grep top


You will notice that the process is now running with a
higher priority 70 with a nice value of -10.
