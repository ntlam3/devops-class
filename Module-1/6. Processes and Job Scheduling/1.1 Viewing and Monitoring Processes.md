# Viewing and Monitoring Processes:

An operational system can have hundreds or thousands of
running processes depending on its purpose.

We can view and monitor these processes using various
native tools such as ps (process status) and top.


- The ps command: 

Shows basic process information in four cloumns.

Example: 

The ps command without any options or arguments lists
processes specific to the terminal where this command
is run.

#: ps

 PID TTY          TIME CMD
12034 pts/0    00:00:00 bash
12749 pts/0    00:00:00 ps

Above output shows basic information in four columns.

PID = process ID number.
TTY = Terminal the process belongs to.
TIME = Cumulative time CPU has given to this process.
CMD = Name of command or program being executed. 


Commonly used options with ps command include:
-a = all
-e = every
-f = full-format
-F = Extra full format
-l = long format


Example: 


#: ps -eaf

UID = User ID or process owner's name.
PID = Process ID number.
PPID = Process ID of the parent process.
C    = Processor utiliztion for the process.
STIME = Process start date or time.
TTY = Terminal the process belongs to.
TIME = Aggregated execution time for the process.
CMD = Name of command or program being executed.

Information of each running process is maintained and
kept in the /proc file system.



- The top command: 
Another popular tool for viewing process info is the
top command.
It displays the statistics in real-time helps to 
identify performance issues on the system.

Example: 

#: top

press q or ctrl c to quit top.


PID � Process ID

USER � Name of the effective user (owner) of the 
process.

PR � Priority

NI � Nice value

VIRT � virtual memory size

RES � resident memory size

SHR � shared memory size

S � process status (which could be one of the 
following: D (uninteruptible sleep), R (running), 

S (sleeping), T (traced or stopped) or Z (zombie)
%CPU � the share of cpu time used by the process 
since last update.

%MEM � share of physical memory used.

TIME+ � total cpu time used by the task in hundredths
of a second.

COMMAND � command name or command line 
(name + options)
