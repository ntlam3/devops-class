# Crontab:

Using crontab is another method of scheduling jobs to
in the future. 

Unlike, atd, crond executes cron jobs on a regular
basis as long as they comply with format defined in the
/etc/crontab file.

#- cat /etc/crontab

Crontables for users are located in the /var/spool/cron
directory. Each authorized user with a scheduled job
has a file matching their user name in this directory.

For example: 

The crontab file for User1 will be:
/var/spool/cron/user1 

Crontables are also stored in /etc/cron.d directory, 
only root user has access to create, modify and delete
them.

When daemon is done running the jobs at the specified 
time, it adds a log entry to /var/log/cron file.


- To check if cron is already installed:

# yum list installed | grep cron
  or
# rpm -qa | grep cron


Crontab command can be used with options:
-e = to edit
-l = to list
-r = remove crontables
