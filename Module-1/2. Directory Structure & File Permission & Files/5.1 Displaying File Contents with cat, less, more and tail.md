- Linux offers several tools for showing file contents.
Directory contents are simply the files and sub-
directories that it contains.

- Using the cat command: 

Examples: 

    #- cat /etc/profile 
Displays the contents of the file profile.

- Using more and less command: 

Examples: 

    #- more /etc/profile
Displays long text files one page at a time, starting
at the beginning.

- Use spacebar to scroll forward one screen at a time.
- Use Enter to scroll one line at a time



        #- less /etc/profile

Similar to more command but offers some extended
capabilities, it is also faster than more as it does
not need to read the entire file before it starts to
show.


- Using head and tail commands: 


Examples:

    #- head /etc/profile
By default it shows first 10 lines of the file.

    #- head -3 /etc/profile
This will show only the first 3 lines of a file.


    #- tail /etc/profile
By default it shows last 10 lines of the file.

    #- tail -3 /etc/profile
This will show only the last 3 lines of a file.
