- Files can be create in multiple ways. However, 
directories can only be created with one command.

- Creating File with touch command: 

Examples: 

    #- touch file1

    #- ls

    #- touch file2 file3 file4

    #- ls

Note : If the file already exists, it will update the
timestamp on it to the current date and time.


- Creating files with vi editor: 

Examples: 

    #- vi filename

- add text
- save and exit 


- Creating directories using mkdir command:

Examples: 

    #- mkdir dir1

To create a directory called dir1

    #- mkdir a b c 

To create 3 directories a b c.

    #- mkdir -p 1/2/3
