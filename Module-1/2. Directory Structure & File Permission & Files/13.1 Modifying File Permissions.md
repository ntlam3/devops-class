- Modifying permissions

Let's look at permissions of file1:

    #- ll file1 and ll file2

`-rwx-w---x. 1 root root 0 May 10 15:34 file1`

`-rwxrwxrwx. 1 root root 0 May 10 16:18 file2`
	

`r` = read

`w` = write

`x` = execute

`u` = user owner

`g` = group owner

`o` = others (or public)

`r` = read     = 4

`w` = write    = 2

`x` = execute  = 1

`rwx`   =	       7 

`rwx-w---x     and  rwxrwxrwx`

`7   2   1	   7   7   7`

- Change rights of a file and grant full rights to 
user, group and others through octal notations.

        #- ll
        #- chmod 777 file
        #- ll

- Change rights of a file - remove read, write and
execute rights for group and others via symbolic
notation.

        #- chmod go-rw file
        #- ll file 

To `re-add` `read` and `write` rights back to `group` & 
others:

    #- chmod go+rw
    $- ll file

- Assign read rights to all users
    
        #- chmod a=rwx
        a = all
