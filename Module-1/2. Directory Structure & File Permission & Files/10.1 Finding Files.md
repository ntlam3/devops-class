- Typical running Linux system has hundreds and 
thousands of files. You may need to search for a files
by a particular user or search file by their size.

- Using the find command

        #- find / -name fi* -print

find = command

`/` = Path or location we want to search

`name` = search option (search by name)

`print` = action (print is default so no need to type it)

`delete` = action

Example: 

- Find all files named "file1": under / directory
and delete them all: 

        #- find / -name files
        #- find / -name files -delete
        #- #- find / -name files


- Find files smaller than 1 MB in root's home directory

        #-  find / -size -1M

- Find files smaller than 1 MB in current directory.

        #-  find . -size -1M
        "." represents current directory


- To find files in /usr, larger than 40MB

        #- find /usr -size +40M


- Find files that were modified 4 days ago:
        
        #- find /var -mtime 4

        #- man find
