- Understanding permissions

Let's look at permissions of file1 and file2:

    #- ll file1 and ll file2

`-rwx-w---x. 1 root root 0 May 10 15:34 file1`

`-rwxrwxrwx. 1 root root 0 May 10 16:18 file2`
	

`r` = read

`w` = write

`x` = execute

`u` = user owner

`g` = group owner

`o` = others (or public)
