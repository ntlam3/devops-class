- There are Certain attributes that can be set on a
file to control what can or cannot be done to it.

For example:

- Attributes can be set to prevent all users including 
root from deleting, modifying, renaming and 
compressing a file.

- These attributes can be set on directories and 
files located in ext3, ext4 or xfs system.

Examples: 

    #- lsattr file1

---------------- file1 (Means no attributes are set)

    #- chattr +a file1

    #- lsattr file1

Now shows: 
-----a---------- file1 (changed attribute)

`a` = only allows append opeartion on the file now.


- Now try to copy contents of a file to file1:

        #- cat /etc/fstab > file1

Operation not permitted, but if you try to append
it will be successfull.


    #- cat /etc/fstab >> file1
    #- cat file1
Shows that the append attribute is applied.



- Add immutable flag to this file to prevent it from 
being deleted or modified

`i` (immutable)= File can't be renamed,changed or deleted.

    #- chattr +i file
    #- lsattr file1
Now shows:  ----ia---------- ./file1

- Try to delete file1 now:

        #- rm file1
Operation not permitted, i has been flag applied.
File cannot be deleted or modified.



- To unset both attributes: 
#- chattr -ia file1
check
#- lsattr file1
Results in:  ---------------- file1


- To find more info on other attributes options:

        #- man chattr

Look under "ATTRIBUTES".
