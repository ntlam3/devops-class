- The copy operation duplicates a file or a directory.

- Use cp command to copy files and directories:

Example: 

    #- cp file1 newfile1

To copy file1 to newfile1

    #- ls


- If the file already exists it gets over written by
default, use -i option if you want a confirmation
before over writing the file.

Example: 

    #- cp -i file1 newfile1


    #- cp -r dir1 dir2

Copy a directory recursively.

    #- ls
