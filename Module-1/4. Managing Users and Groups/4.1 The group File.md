# The group File: 

This file contains the group info. Each row in the file
stores one group entry.

#- cat /etc/group
To view the file.

Every user in the system must be a member of atleast 
one group - refered to as the user's Primary group.

By default, a group name matches the username.

- For Example: 

By default 
Group name user1 will be the primary group of user1
Group name root will be the primary group of root user

This default group is known as User Private Group(UPG)
and it safeguards a user's files from other users.



- There are 4 fields per line separated by a colon :

Examples:

#- grep username /etc/group
user1:x:1004:
root:x:0:

Field 1: user1 = Group name 
Same as user name by default 

Field 2: x = Password Placeholder
x point to gshadow file for password

Field 3: 1004 = GID (group identifier or group ID)

By default groups are ceated with GID's starting at
1000. Several users can be part of one group and a
user can be part of multiple groups.

Field 4: Blank = Group members
Blank (if no members) as user's primary group is listed
in the /etc/passwd file and not the group file.
