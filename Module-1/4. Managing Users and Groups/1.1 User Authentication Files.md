# Cat - Types of users served by the authentication files: 

Linux supports three types of user accounts: root, 
normal and serice.


- The root user: 
The root User is the superuser or administrator with 
full access to all services, administrative functions 
and  possesses full powers on the system.
This user is automatically created during Linux 
installation. 

- The normal user:
The normal users have user-level previlages. They cannot 
perform any administrative functions, but can run 
applications and programs that they are authorized to 
execute. 

- The service account: 

The service accounts are responsible for taking care of
the installed services. The service accounts include 
apache, ftp, mail, ntp, postfix and qemu.



- Authentication Files:

Account info for these users is stored in four files
located in the /etc directory.

These files are passwd, shadow, group and gshadow. These
files are updated when a user account is created, 
modified or deleted. 

These authentication files are referenced to check and 
validate the credentials when a user attempts to login.

These files are so important that the system keeps a
backup of each of these files as passwd-, shadow-, 
group- and gshadow- in /etc directory.

Example: 
#- ls /etc/shadow*

/etc/shadow  /etc/shadow-

- All four files will be covered in the next lectures.
