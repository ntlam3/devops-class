The sudo utility: 

Linux gives normal users the ability to run privileged
commands. There is a utility called sudo that can be 
used for this purpose.


- For example, a regular user can run useradd command 
with sudo if they have been granted access: 
#- sudo useradd
password


- Rights provided to sudo users can be used to allow
a user or a group to run scripts and applications
owned by a different user.


- Rights an be provided by editing a file /etc/sudoers.
- File can be edited by using visudo command.

- To give ALL privileges to administrative commands on 
the system to both a user called test and a group 
called wheel, add the below line to /etc/sudoers file: 

test    ALL=(ALL)      ALL
%wheel  ALL=(ALL)      ALL


- To give access to users and groups so they can run 
privileged commands without getting prompted for a
password, below lines can be added to sudoers file.

test    ALL=(ALL)    NOPASSWD: ALL
%wheel  ALL=(ALL)    NOPASSWD: ALL


- Rights can also be granted to users and groups in 
a restricted way:

user	All=/usr/sbin/userdel,/usr/sbin/adduser
%wheel	All=/usr/sbin/userdel,/usr/sbin/adduser
