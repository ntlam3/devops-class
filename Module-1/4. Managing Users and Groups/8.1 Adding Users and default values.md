# Adding Users

- The useradd and login.defs:

The useradd command picks up the default values from the
/etc/default/useradd and /etc/login.defs files for any
options that are not specified at the command line.

The login.defs file is also consulted by the usermod, 
userdel, chage and passwd commands as needed.

- To view useradd file:

#- cat /etc/default/useradd
or
#- useradd -D


These default values can be modified as desired.


Example: 

- To change the default base directory to /usr/home as 
the home directory: 

#- useradd -D -b /usr/home

To confirm: 
#- useradd -D



- The other file /etc/login.defs comprises of additional
directives that set several defaults.

User and group management commands consult the file
/etc/login.defs to obtain info that is not specified at
the command line.


- Example: 

To view the file login.defs a grep is shown on the 
uncommented and non-empty lines use below command:

#- grep -v ^# /etc/login.defs | grep -v ^$
