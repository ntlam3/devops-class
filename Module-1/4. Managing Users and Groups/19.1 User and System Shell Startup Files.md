- System-wide Shell startup files: 

System-wide startup files set the general environment
for all users at the time of their login to the 
system. These files are:

- /etc/bashrc: 

Defines functions and aliases, sets the umask value, 
the command prompt, etc. It includes settings from
the shell scripts located in the /etc/profile.d
directory.

- /etc/profile: 

Sets environment variables such as PATH, USER, MAIL,
LOGNAME, HOSTNAME, HISTSIZE and HISTCONTROL for users
and startup programs. Also processes shell scripts
located in /etc/profile.d directory.


- /etc/profile.d: 

Contains scripts for bash and C shell users that are
executed by /etc/profile file. Additional scripts 
can be created here for further enviroment changes.

#- cat /etc/bashrc

#- cat /etc/profile

#- ll /etc/profile.d




- Per-user Shell startup files: 

These files override or modify default system-wide
settings. Individual users can customize these files
to suit their needs. These get copied into user's
home directory at the time of their creation.

Per-user startup files for bash shell users:

~/.bashrc:
Defines functions and aliases. This file sources
global definitons from /etc/bashrc file.

~/.bashrc_profile:

Sets environment variables. This file sources the

~/.bashrc file to set functions and aliases.

 
#- cat ~/.bashrc

#- cat ~/.bashrc_profile
