# Integrity of Authentiction files: 


The pwck command verifies the integrity of the users and
authentication information. 
It checks that all entries in /etc/passwd and 
/etc/shadow have the proper format and contain valid 
data. The user is prompted to delete entries that are
improperly formatted or which have other uncorrectable
errors.

Example: 

#- pwck:

user 'ftp': directory '/var/ftp' does not exist

pwck: no changes




- Preventing Corruption in Authentication files: 

When an admin needs to edit passwd or the group file
manually, and if another user is changing his password 
at the same time - the admin changes to the file will
be lost. 
Command vigr or vipw locks the file so editing of the
files by another user by will be locked for that
duration.

The vipw and vigr commands edits the files /etc/passwd 
and /etc/group, respectively.
 
With the -s flag, they will edit the shadow versions
of those files:
/etc/shadow and /etc/gshadow, respectively. 

The programs will set the appropriate locks to prevent
file corruption.
 
When looking for an editor, the programs will first
try the environment variable $VISUAL, then the
environment variable $EDITOR, and finally the default
editor, vi.

[root@centos example]# vigr -s
vigr: Couldn't lock file: Interrupted system call
vigr: /etc/gshadow is unchanged

As the file is being edited either by a command or
via vigr so invoking another session generates the 
above error.
