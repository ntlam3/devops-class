- In a real world scenario most of the time a system
administrator creates user accounts with custom values.



- Creating a User with Custom Values:

#- useradd -u 1010 -g 1001 -m -d /home/user9 -k 
/etc/skel -s /bin/bash user9

-u     =  UID set to 1010
-m -d  =  Home directory set to /home/user9
-s     =  shell set to /bin/bash
-g     =  group membership se to 1001
-k     =  Default startup files copied into user's 
          home directory.


- Assign password: 
#- passwd user9


- Confirm Authentication files to see what was added
for this user:

#- cd /etc ; grep user9 passwd shadow group gshadow
