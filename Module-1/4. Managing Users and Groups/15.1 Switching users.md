Switching Users: 

Logging in to the system directly as root is not 
recommended. The recommended practice is to log on with 
normal user account and then switch into the root 
account if necessary.

In addition to becoming root, we can also switch into 
another user account. Unless you are root, you need to
know the password for the target user account you are
switching to.

The su command can used to switch into another user
account.

Example: 

- To switch from a user to root without executing 
startup scripts for the target user:
#- su
Password (root pw)



- To switch into a different user account from user1
to user2, specify the name of the target user with the
command: 
#- su - user2
Password (user2 password)


- You can also issue a command as a different user 
without switching into that user: 

#- su -c 'firewall-cmd --list-services'
Password (root password)

-c option is available with su.
- firewall-cmd --list-services requires superuser
privileges.
- users can use su to execute privileged commands. 


- User root can switch into any account without being
prompted for that user's password.

#- su user1
