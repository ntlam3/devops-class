- "No login" shell is primarily used for application 
accounts. As these accounts do not require login access
to the system. 



- To create a user123 with shell file /sbin/nologin:
#- useradd -s /sbin/nologin user123


- Check if the shell is assigned correctly: 
#- grep user123 /etc/passwd



- Try to login to make sure login is denied.
#- su user123


Note: 
The nologin shell can also be assigned to a regular
user to disable access temporarily.
