# The gshadow File: 

The shadow password implemention provides an added layer
of security at the group level. 
With this mechanism active, the group passwords are 
encrypted and stored in a secure /etc/gshadow file, only
readable by the root user.

#- cat /etc/gshadow

To view gshadow as root

- This file stores encrypted group passwords. Each row
in file responds to one entry in the group file.

There are 4 fields per line, separated by a colon :

- Examples: 
#- grep username /etc/gshadow

root:::

test:!!::test

user1:!::

Field 1: test = Group Name(as it appears in /etc/group)

Field 2: !, !!, blank = Contains encrypted pw, ! or !!
- Encypted pw can be set with gpasswd command.
- Single ! disallows users access to this group with the
newgroup command.
- Pair of !! means same restriction as signle ! and it
also indicates that group pw has never been set.

Field 3: Blank = Group Admins
Lists group admins that can add/remove users to from 
this group with gpasswd command.

Field 4: Test and blank = Members
Users that belong to the group.
