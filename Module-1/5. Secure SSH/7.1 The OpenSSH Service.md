# Ssh

OpenSSH is a free and open source implementation of SSH.
Once applied on the system - telnet, rlogin, rsh, rexec,
and ftp services can be disabled to enhance security.

The ssh command has replaced telnet, rlogin, rsh, rexec
and rcp,ftp commands have been replaced by scp, sftp
respectively. 



Example: 

- To transfer files securely from source to destination:

#- scp  /file1  servername:/file1

#- ssh user@servername

#- man ssh

 ssh (SSH client) is a program for logging into a
 remote machine and for executing commands on a remote
 machine.  It is intended to provide secure encrypted
 communications between two untrusted hosts over an
 insecure network.  X11 connections, arbitrary TCP
 ports and UNIX-domain sockets can also be forwarded
 over the secure channel.
