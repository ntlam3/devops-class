OpenSSH currently supports 2 versions: v1 and v2. Both 
are available in RHEL/Centos 7.
Newer version should used as it has enhanced features 
and configuration options.

Configuration file is located in /etc/ssh/sshd_config.

#- cat /etc/ssh/sshd_config

Check for installed ssh packages:

#- rpm -qa | grep ssh.


- Both versions support various algorithms for data 
encryption and user authentication (digital signatures).

OpenSSH v1: 
Supports the RSA Algorithm only.

OpenSSH v2: 
Supports RSA, DSA and ECDSA.

RSA:
Rivest-Shamir-Adleman, who first published this
Algorith.
RSA is most commonly used becuase it supports both
encryption and digital signatures.

DSA: 
Digital Signature Algorithm

ECDSA:
Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm.
