#  Introduction to SSH Secure Shell: 

Secure Shell SSH provides a secure mechanism for data
transmission between source and destination systems over
IP networks. 

It replaces older remote login programs that transmitted
user password in clear text(Telnet) and unencrypted data.

SSH uses encryption for secure communication and digital
signatures for user authentication.

It also ensures integrity of the data being transfered.

SSH includes a set of utilities and provides remote 
users the ability to login, transfer files and securely
execute commands. 

SSH utilities have widely replaced other unsecure login
and file transfer programs.

SSH operates over port 22, unless you configure it
otherwise. 

Example: 

#- ssh servername (test)

#- man ssh
