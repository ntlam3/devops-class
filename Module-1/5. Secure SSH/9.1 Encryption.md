Encryption is a way of transforming information into a 
scrambled form to conceal the real informtion from 
unauthorized access. 

Encryption is done at the client end and the reverse
process is de-encryption, which is on the server end.

OpenSSH uses many encryption techniques during an end 
to end communication session.

These techniques include symmetric and asymmetric
encryption. 


- Symmetric Encryption: 

This type of encryption uses a single secret key or a
pair of keys to protect authentication traffic as well
as the entire communication session. 
This key is generated as a result of a negotiation 
process between the client and server.


- Asymmetric Encryption:

This encryption uses a private/public key combination
for encryption. These keys are randomly generated
alphanumeric characters attached to messages during a
communication session. 

The client transfers the information using a public key
and the server decrypts it using the paired private key.

The private key must be kept secure since it is private
to that one system only. The public key is distributed
to clients. 

This method is used for channel encryption as well as 
for user authentication.
