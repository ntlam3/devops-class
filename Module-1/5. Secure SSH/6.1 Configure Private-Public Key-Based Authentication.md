# Configure Private-Public Key-Based Authentication:

In this example you will generate private/public key
combination for a user on one server and use it to 
allow this user to access another server using the ssh
command.

1- log onto centos (server name)
2- ssh-keygen
3- cat /home/user1/.ssh/id_rsa
4- ssh-copy-id -i id_rsa.pub test(server name)
5- ssh test as user2
