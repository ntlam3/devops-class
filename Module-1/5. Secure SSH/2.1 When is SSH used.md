# When is SSH used?


Most servers are located in data centers or equipment 
racks far away from the system admins and users.


Same is true for routers, switches and other network
devices.


In most cases it's not practical to physically visit the
console of each server that you manage, so instead we
install SSH clients susch as PuTTY or TeraTerm on
Windows computers or OpenSSH on Macs and nix computers.


We can then use such software to log in across the
network to the remote servers and other network devices.


That is how system administrators manage servers from 
the command line as though they were actually sitting
at the physical console.
