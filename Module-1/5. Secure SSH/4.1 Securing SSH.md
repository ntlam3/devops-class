# Securing SSH:

From security standpoint, there are two easy things to
do to make SSH secure:

1- Change the default port:

The default port is 22, but its easy to change it to
something else within the dynamic port range of
49,153 to 65,535. 

A hacker running a system wide port scan can still 
discover it but it is better than having port 22 as a
default which almost everyone knows.

Usually hackers are looking for easy targets and they
move on to an easier target if it takes too long.


2- Disable root login:

On most internet connected servers, usually logs will
indicate tons of attempts using username root by the
bad guys.
Everyone knows Linux admin username is root so they will
try to penetrate the system with that username first.

Example:
- Make a backup of sshd_config
- vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
- Change port 22 to 5000
- Change PermitRootLogin from yes to no

Note: Now you will have to login with a regular user
instead of root via SSH.
