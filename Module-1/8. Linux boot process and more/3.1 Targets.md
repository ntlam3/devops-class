# Targets:

Systemd has replaced sysVinit as the default service 
manager in RHEL 7. Some of the sysVinit commands have
been symlinked to their RHEL 7 counterparts, however 
this will eventually be deprecated in favor of the 
standard systemd commands in the future.

Systemd uses Targets instead of the runlevels.


- Each Runlevel Target file is a symbolic link to the
system-start Target equivalents. For example:

# cd /usr/lib/systemd/system
# ls -l runlevel*




Comapring runlevel with Target: 

Runlevel 0 � shut down the system
Runlevel 1 � single mode
Runlevel 2 � multiuser mode without networking
Runlevel 3 � multiuser with text login screen
Runlevel 4- customized runlevel (not in use)
Runlevel 5 � runlevel 3 with graphical login
Runlevel 6 � Reboots the system


Targets: 

0- runlevel 0.target, poweroff.target 
System halt/shutdown

1- runlevel1.target, rescue.target
Single-user mode (rescue mode)

2- runlevel2.target
User-defined/Site-specific runlevels. By default, 
identical to 3.

3- runlevel3.target, multi-user.target
Multi-user, non-graphical mode, command line

4-  runlevel4.target
User-defined/Site-specific runlevels. By default, 
identical to 3.

5- runlevel5.target, graphical.target
Multi-user, graphical mode

6- runlevel6.target, reboot.target
Reboot


- emergency- emergency.target
Emergency mode. Root fs is mounted read only, no other
fs are mounted and no networking either.



- Managing Targets



Viewing and setting Default boot Target:

- To check current default boot target
# systemctl get-default

multi-user.target


- To change default boot target:
# systemctl set-default multi-user.target

-----

Switching into specific targets: 

- Switch to graphical target (Legacy runlevel 5)
# systemctl isolate graphical.target

- Switch to multi-user Target (Legacy runlevel 3)
# systemctl isolate multi-user.target

- Shutdown system to halt state:
# systemctl halt

- Shutdown and power off
# systemctl poweroff

- Reboot
# systemctl reboot

- To switch to Legacy runlevel 3 Target:
# systemctl isolate runlevel3.target
