Determines the state of a system and controls how one
can login, what services and scripts should run when a 
system starts.  

Defaults runlevels vary from distro to distro, as do the
default settings in each run level.

Below are the run levels for Redhat/CentOS 6.

- Runlevel 0 � Shut down the system 
(do not make it default)

- Runlevel 1 � single mode

- Runlevel 2 � multiuser mode without networking
(no NFS support)

- Runlevel 4- Not used

- Runlevel 5 � X11 (GUI)
(Good for end-user systems, NOT recommended for Servers)


- Runlevel 6 � Reboots the system
