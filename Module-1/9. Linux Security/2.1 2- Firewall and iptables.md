- Understanding and Managing Firewall

- iptables with and without firewalld

# yum list installed | grep iptables
# yum list installed | grep firewalld


- iptables Configuration File
# cat /etc/sysconfig/iptables


- iptables and firewalld services:

# systemctl enable firewalld (Autostart)
# systemctl start firewalld (start service)
# systemctl status firewalls -l

To stop this service:
# systemctl stop firewalld
# systemctl disable firewalld

Similarly for iptables:
# systemctl enable iptables
# systemctl start iptables

- To List the rules currently in place:
# iptables -L
- To remove all existing rules:
# iptables -F

- Insert a rule to allow inbound traffic on port 90
from 192.168.1.0/24 only:
# iptables -I INPUT -s 192.168.1.0/24 -p tcp --dport
90 -j ACCEPT

# Service iptables save (Save rules)
# iptables -L (To check)

- Add a runtime rule to allow traffic on TCP port 443:
# firewall-cmd --add-port=443/tcp

- To List Services
# firewall-cmd --list-services

- To List Ports:
# firewall-cmd --list-ports
